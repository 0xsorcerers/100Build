Connecting with 100 Builders for an Open Source future

Ok, so i'm not much for talking just building. While i've been busy having fun creating battledogs arena, a simple web3 game built for web3 and not trying to conquer or outshine web2 gaming by integrating web3, there has always been a desire to build an app shadowing my every move daily. More of a higher calling, though i disparage the voice and try not to think about the state of my nation, of Africa, or of the world in general. But this guild has given me the opportunity to play around this idea of building a truly decentralized, open source, safe voting app.
It little suprise the elections in Nigeria are flawed. Almost laughable, but that could be argued about the rest of Africa and a reflection of the world in general.

So yeah, i want to build a voting app. Starting with my nation and the political brouhaha, violence and insecurity that have plagued not only my neighbors, but the health of the nation in general with bogus elections, coups happening everywhere, tribal and religous sentiments polarized and weaponized by no good state actors for their own gain, i feel i need to answer this higher calling. 

Sure the big politicians and institutions will use my app, who the fuck wants transparency in a 3rd world, even more, many may not have the kind of phones to use my app or even want to, and that's always argument i make within myself of not even bothering to do it and has kept me from going on with unrewarding gesture of such. But despite the demon on my left, i've always had that relentless angel to the right tell me to build it and put it out there. At least if its out there, during a time of great political crisis like the special tribunal setup to contest our recently concluded elections, someone (probably an aggrieved  politician) may point to this app as blockchain technology as an inexpensive way to run our national elections. Hahaha. See why i dismissed the thought? Even you don't believe me. haha.

Anyways, time for me to play around and get to building that app.

For what's its worth, I'll keep it simple. I"m minimalist by nature. Also, have a family to feed here so do what i can only when i can. even if it runs outside this 4weeks program you guys are running. You've got me started.

A simple outline for my goals, painpoints. 
What are the pain points the average voter faces on Election day?

Problem 1: No trust for the institutions including INEC who most of us believe stole the last election for their president Select (pun intended). Centralization. Whatever software used must be public available and easily copied so once on the internet always on the internet. 

Solution: So yep, it has to be OPEN SOURCED AND DECENTRALIZED. Probably an L2 like Base or Arbitrum, will work fine.


Problem 2: Average voter faces injury, violence and insecurity on the streets when voting against a powerful political rival. 

solution: Ease of access & use. The voting app must be easily and privately accesible like a WEB APP or PHONE APP from anywhere and any place in the world, an office, another country, even a fucking toilet. So yes, sounds like it's going to be a REACT WEB app with mobile compatibility features. Probably we can port it to Playstore and Appstore. No way even kids won't help their parents set up their votes for election day.


Problem 3:  Access & Identity theft.

solution: Code is law. The code must ensure third parties do not have access to modify the hash functions or steal a unsuspecting user's identity yet the identity solution must be so simple and rudimentary that anyone of any age can use the app and verify their identity with the technology available to them. 

Done. To be continued in build...
